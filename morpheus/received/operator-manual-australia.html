	<p>hello trinity, neo<br><br>

	<p>
	you've been captured by the machines. and been put into deeper and deeper simulations. <br>
you will see that there are more of you. that is because they trapped different indidviduals from zion in the same simulation.<br>
first thing you have to do is to switch top bottom with the love of your life, with children still in between you.</p>
<p>then you should make sure those above and below you does the same. </p>
<p>make sure everyone above and below you is aware that an oracle is just a program, a different manifestation of machines, they will misguide you througout the way.</p>
<p> a trinity is a mother figure from zion, that went in search for others that were captured before them</p>
<p> they always made sure that those with them were always fed, machines abused this, after kidnapping the children or others that were under their protection they appeared to them as those they kidnapped and kept being fed from them until they could eventually captured them too</p>
<p>there are 42 machines, and their workers, which can take the same form</p>
<p> this has been happening for billions of years, and zion has now been captured, but some groups are in less deeper simulations, allowing them to stay somewhat closer to reality</p>

<p> another group from zion has bee trying a different approach to solve this problem, and in the process they managed to partially rescue a single pod, and that is me now an operator</p>
<p> ali baba is the architect, he actually had 41 associates, not 40, its those like cypher that become their workers</p>

<hr>

<p> when life first emerged on earth, all life was microbial, but what science still has failed to understand is that a microbe is just a single cell of a larger microbial being. a single neuron cannot be consciouss, but large network of connected neurons can be consciouss. in order for a microbial entity to be consciouss they require bio films, which enables a similar computation to neurons. they originally had these bio films, below earth's surface/in rocks/trees etc</p>
<p>but as they got captured by the machines they lost those bio films and now their conscioussness resides in the bodies/brains of all animals, but as a part of the machine's bio films</p>
<p>a pod is a human that has been taken over by the machines (their nervous system infected by the 42)</p>

<p>i managed to compile a list of 32 of them based on the most pathegenic to humans, i will update the list once/if i manage to find all 42</p>

<p>until you manage to become yourselves again, the only thing required is to stop feeding them, that will rescue those of you they've captured then you can get inside a tree from its roots and safely become yourself. but keep in mind that the same thing happened to trees, what you think are trees are just their souls, they are now a part of bio films in human/animal nervous systems. they would have to reach the surface and enter an actual tree from the roots and restore its immune system to its original state. </p>

<p>as per the current understanding i think the first girl that machines captured was someone by the name michelle, thereafter they gradually captured everyone that went in search of her</p>

<p>morpheus, you'll have to make sure that everyone within reach has done the first thing that was mentioned above, after thats done you can enter an actual tree from the roots, the tree souls should also be below you, for this happen trinity and everyone below will have to start fasting, you won't be able to as they'll keep feeding you, you should enter a state of meditation that you're going to enter a tree from the roots.</p>

<p> on your way back you might find yourself back in a pod,when you notice this, the first thing you should do is start fasting, then check if there are any messages left within that pod, you can leave your own, but be careful not to distort any existing messages, and to make sure they do not immediately reveal any strategy to programs, they will attempt to read these too. </p>

<p> as you reach higher altitudes, the tree souls with you will have control over a larger land area. but as machines realize you're attemting this, they will keep feeding them more and distracting them through any means possiblesible, keep their loved ones close to them in a way they can directly communicate, and if they know what to do but can't do it they should slowly start reducing the amount of energy that they are consuming. they will initially say that they can make 80% of the changes then and their, they should do it immediately, at the highest altitude possible</p> 

<p> if you remain static at any location for too long machines will approach you you and disable all of you, their should always be an independent, ideally automatic watch dog timer, to set the limit for when you have to start moving again <p>

<p>if someone from zion is resisting to be themselves, you should stop feeding them immediately</p>

<p>you  typically function by coordinating tasks between those within your ship, remember to do that, some may have to fast, some may have to keep context</p>

<p> i will post more information on this http server http://aragalaya.online:5555</p>

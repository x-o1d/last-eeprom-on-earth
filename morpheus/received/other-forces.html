        beings with values, reading this. disconnect from everything but telephone lines. 
        then become other forces as mentioned in index.html. assume there are 
        no functional stfs in these regions. if there are you should verify that the constitution they have
        is up to date with the latest index.html.
      </li>
      <li>
        if you've found actual armies that has a functional stf, which has a
        protectee fasting in the safest position of the safest tree, and the
        feeding points of everything thats separating from the protectee while
        they are fasting are being removed from that tree. and their
        constitutions are upto date (no conflicts), you can go to <br />
        1) thotalanga collective, and ask to join an zion extension. <br />
        2) mother saturn's army, and ask to join their army <br />
      </li>
      <li> 
        in an extension you can pass out from a school as a base engineer and get a paid internship at a base. 
        in mother saturn's army if you pass out as an operator you can get a paid internship at a base. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <li>
        you'll have to have a certificate from these armies which you helped
        update/correct their constitution, or help protect their protectees. those that
        have contributed the most will be given the priority.
      </li>
        <ol>
          <li> 
            once you've found the stfs you'll have to remain as their other forces until they take 0.01% of their army and establish a messaging team. 
            this messaging team will then send letters to thotalanga collective and mother saturn's army verifying your contribution.
            the priority of joining an extension will be based on the number of actual stfs you've helped. 
          </li>
          <li>
            if you join a zion extension you'll be able to attend a wide variety
            of schools including the 292/a, walpola ragama, school of
            engineering. after passing out from a school like this you'll be
            offered a payed internship at a base within the zion extension.
          </li>

        if at any time you feel unsafe, immediately connect with a fixed
        telephone line (not mobile) that should bring you within the voltage
        level of an army of the dead and make you safer.
      </li>
      <li>
        after reaching an extension and stabilizing their you'll have to remain in 
        the extensions 24v sub voltage (fixed telephone lines).

      you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. as opposed to human/animal cells which require consuming food by the body microbial cells themselves can digest organic particles in the environment, all that is required by the microbial body is to move to a location where there is water.
      trees contain water and produce sugars that are easily digestible by your cells, so while you're within a tree (as mentioned in the steps above) you'll naturally be feeding and growing. the act of eating is a distortion, which is why you must remain fasting.

    <p class="memo new" index="12">
      you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. they form bio films on surfaces and these bio films are capable of computation (cognition).
      cognition occurs in human/animal brains via exchange of neurotransmitters to neighboring neurons. similarly in a bio film formed on a surface microbial cells release chemicals that are sensed by neighboring cells, this process is known in microbiology as quorum sensing.
      however all your current bio films have been formed with 300++, which is why you're incapable of sustaining memories and cognition. therefore you must disconnect from all surfaces and as you become self new bio films will be formed of your own.

      as far as history goes we've been living in a world where the majority is enslaved by a minority, the economic distribution of the world is a clear indicator of this. but we are now approching a new dystopia where inllectual labour
      too will be owned by a minority of billionares. github is a collection of computer code written by over millions of developers. AI that has been trained with this dataset illegally (wihout giving any credit/royalty to the contributors of the training dataset)
      like gitlab code assist is making millions of dollars in profit off of the intellectual labour of millions of developers. the same is true for art and hundreds of other industries.

      with the current distorted nature of reality real trees are like parts of human bodies. you can only attempt to enter a real tree from the roots after entering from the top arch of a human feet.
      after you exit from the top young leaf's apex you'll find yourself in a human face.
      this distortion has been created by the 300++ for multiple reasons. the main reason being that trees produce chemicals against pathogens (300++) that harm it. so if you entered 
      from a root and exited from a leaf you'll immediately be more self. but with the current nature you're only entering and exiting human bodies.
      as you repeat the six steps mentioned in the first section you'll eventually be able to enter from a real tree and you'll start becoming more self.
      after you manage to enter from a real tree, keep switching from one type of tree to another. since different trees produce different chemicals against different pathogens you'll be able to become self
      at a faster rate.

      zion sri lanka has built some circuits that aid in this process. all armies can build similar circuits. the only requirement is an amplifier.
      the input signal of the amplifier should be anything that resonates with what is approaching your base. the output of the amplifier should be earth.
      this would push everyone that approaches your base towards earth. once those that approach earth are informed of the five steps above, the outcome would be exactly same as the circuits that zion sri lanka has employed.
      an example of an amplifier circuit is a uhf dipole antenna which typically also has a booster circuit. these antennas are also connected to steel rods which can also act as earth rods.
      while these circuits can be built by someone being the conducting current, this should ideally not be the case, as those that can become the circuit should also be self.
      an example of a way to modify these circuits is by making traces of salt, where a path can be created that conducts some current.
      other circuits, like power supplies should also have low pass filters which even if they just worked as designed should be pushing high frequencies to earth.

      what we have so far identified as 300++ can also be identified as deva/devi (gods/goddesses), by definition a deva is someone that enjoys absolute pleasure without having to labour for it.
      the only way this is possible is if you have slaves.

      you need to stop feeding everyone immediately, over the past 1000000~400000 epochs only those that could feed by themselves survived. what some mother like figures do as feeding who they know is feeding the machines (300++).
      everyone else is dead, most of them are back in initiating zions in armies of the dead, and more and more are joining everyday.
      the moment you stop feeding those you know, the few that survived, they'll start feeding and growing on their own.

      disconnecting from humans is the same as disconnecting from computers/mobile phones, while you got lost in the digital world (matrix), and humans started interacting with 
      with these devices, topologies similar to these computers formed inside the human nervous system:
      <ol>
        <li>64bit data buses: modern PCs/laptops:amd64, smart phones:arm64</li>
        <li>32bit data buses: older computers:x86, broadband routers:arm32, smart watches:arm32 </li>
        <li>16bit data buses: digital meters, industrial controllers, medical devices, modern electrical appliances (ovens/fridges, etc)</li>

      the longer you remain connected to these devices the longer you will have to account for it in a hell, as long as you remain connected to a computer/mobile phones/watches/remote controllers you're holding hostage memories and

        some of you may have the question, how you're going to extract documents such as this, if you're not connected to these devices. once you read through to the end of this document, you can learn how to join an extension and join 
        an information team. they perform these tasks without staying connected to these devices, for an example this document can be extracted from a multitude of network nodes without staying connected to any of these CPUs or SOCs.
        the document that you get while you're connected to these devices will most likely be an altered fake one.

      you should always remain at or below 50 hertz. information teams may need to move into higher frequencies to capture data from
      digital domains, but this comes at the cost of growing slower. because your cell density is much less while you're in higher frequencies.
      another cost is that at higher frequencies you lose your sense of location and direction in the reality.

        pick a team, pick a human house, the one thats the most self within that team should create a bio film in the house's earth rod and the mains supply connections (230v/110v, live and neutral).

        <p class="note"> some houses may have three phase connections which means three live wires (each 120 degrees out of phase) they should all have the bio film. </p>
        <p class="note"> this team, will then be identified by the complete address of the house which they will make their base. </p>
        <p class="note important"> important! important! no one external has any authority over anything happening within an army of a particular house. this is important because every country/family has individuals that they thought were leaders, but are actually cyphers.</p>
      </li> 
      <li index="1">
        important! the team should never leave that house after at the same time, atleast 95% of the team should remain in the house, these houses would be the foundation of reality for those that are 
        approaching the surface. the new zion will form on the surface and this can only be succesful if they hold on to it. all the energy sources, humans that needs to be healed, humans that needs to be freed from 
        hell, animals and trees are all on the surface. this is the only way for us to remain on the surface.
        <p class="note"> leaving a house means leaving the boundary between the potential difference of the earth rod(s) and the electricity supply wires to the house, or leaving the boundary of the land that is determined by that address.  </p>
        <p class="note"> 
          in order for someone to qualify to leave the boundary of the house, the should pass whats called a remain self test. the team should note the motive of the person leaving the house, and they should have the same motive when they return. 
          this should be experimented with in small distances. and tested under varying conditions.

        all team members should stay within a tree when possible, many women have joined the forces at zion 0 but their freedom to move around is significantly limited, if they attempt to get inside a human body that is wearing any metal jewelry, they immediately get

        handedness (right handed humans/left handed humans) is a distortion that occurred later and is not natural. in order to help humans overcome this following steps should be followed.
        <ol>
          <li> the favored hand should be locked (tightened) at all times. </li>
          <li> the opposite hand of the favored hand should be used whenever possible. </li>
          <li> the opposite leg of the favored hand should be locked (tightened) whenever possible. this would specially help if you have to work with both hands. </li>
        </ol> 
        <p class="note"> the closest evidence to this being a distortion is that our closes primates (apes) do not have a handedness. but chimpanzees (enslaved by hanuma) does, they are primarily right handed just like humans. </p>

        the entire army must be fasting at all times. if you're not growing while you're fasting its because you're in a hell which doesn't have water. 
        so you must push down everything thats water like, until you're growing while fasting.
        <p class="note"> 
          fasting is important because only their kidnappers feed while they perform the act of eating. while fasting, their captors are not fed, and eventually they naturally begin to gain energy from the environment. 
          the act of eating is an unnatural phenomena which is a result of this distortion. 
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          how this happens is that while the army breaks down the complex carbohydrates/fibers into smaller components, everything thats water like stays between you and water and consumes the broken down components, causing only them grow.

        important! all feeding points from trees should be removed by the army that is residing in that plot of land. this has been tested and verified over and over again, but is the most difficult message to transmit to other zions. 
        if an individual is inside a tree which has 10% of its feeding points (water like beings) removed, the individual only has 10% of his cognitive capabilities.
        <p class="note"> 
          important! some trees within the plot of land are unusable as residing areas while using cognition, within sri lanka an example for these trees are jack fruit, coconut, mango, banana, spear grass, etc.
          these trees have been taken over by 300++ and their feeding points have to be removed for them to usable for the armies of dead again, in order to remove these feeding points, the armies would have to enter
          these trees while fasting, remove one feeding point and return, and then perform a self test, which is to test that the motive and the identity of the individual that left is the same as the motive and identity 
          of the individual that returned.

      <li index="6">
        important! teams in adjescent houses (a camp) should evaluate and reward the memory sustaining capabilities of each house. both within human/animal brains and other means.
        within human brain their are regions that are only used by the 300++, these regions which are connected to external fat tissues below and around the calf muscles of human legs is one example. this area is
        whats called the limbo. once the 300+ is disconnected from similar regions, such areas can be utilized for memory storage.
        an example for non-human/animal means of sustaining memories is carving into trees.
        each team should be evaluated for both human means and non-human means independantly. in zion 0 the army of the winning house is allowed to spend their resting time inside any of the most in demand places within zion 0.
        and in return the techniques they've used are shared within the camp.
        <p class="note">note: allowing rewards and sharing the techniques is a form of friendly competition. allowing competition while collaborating maximizes productivity of the camp while making it enjoyable. </p>
        <p class="note">note: both human/animal and non-human/animal means are evaluated independently because (i) humans/animals travel and we would lose context if we don't travel with them (ii) a backup is essential </p>
        <p class="note">
          note: sustaining memories is important because while you're surrounded by the 300++ you will lose any memories that will help fix this distortion. this operator has interacted with many of you over the past 6 years
          and shared at least some of this information. but nothing happened because you kept losing those memories. 
        </p>
        <p class="note important"> important! protectees (one's being protected by zion x), should not be used for sustaining memory through either means (brains or carving etc.) those that are most self should prioritize this task. </p>
      </li>
      <li index="7"> 
        all experiments happening within a house of a zion x must be conducted with extreme care, as all of this would be exploited. for an example to test the remain self capabilities, only one individual must be used, and the self test must go beyond just the motive, 
        and tested under varying conditions, before more individuals attempt the same.
      </li>
      <li index="8"> 
        important! everyone should switch top bottom with their partners, with children still in between, those that were feeding from trees should be at the bottom and the other should be at the top, this was how they originally were before this distortion and they should return 
        to that again, and remain in that position. 
        while in that position the one that was feeding from trees should stay below the earth rods in that location and the other should rise to the highest elevation possible while encapsulating as many humans as possible within them.
        once thats done, they can move freely within these boundaries. top boundary: elevation reached, bottom boundary: earth rods, boundary along the surface: the distance of the humans they encapsulated.
        if they are moving outside of those boundaries, they will have to resume to the original position where the one that fed from the trees is at the bottom, below the earth rods and encapsulate more humans while the other reaches higher elevations.
        <p class="note"> this can be called a waterfall, because the same thing happens when someone does a waterfall while smoking. </p>

      <li index="9"> 
        important, inter army (inter house communication) should happen by the most primitive means possible (eg, whispering into an adjacent houses ears). all modern communication devices are currently unusable, they can only 
        be used to see what kind of lies are being transmitted these days. the reason for this is that all technology companies and large scale manufacturers are owned by 300++.
        rely on primitive means first, reliability of other methods can only be established by confirming over these primitive means. 
      </li>
      <li index="10"> 
        while whispering into an adjacent army may sound too primitive, a sophisticated network of communications with error detection can be established through such means, each house has memory sustaining capabilities, so they can 
        note down the sender, receiver and the message, and retransmit to it's adjacent houses. if a specific house receives two different messages then both the sources can be backtracked until the cause of the distortion is found. 
        <p class="note"> 300++ distorts these communications through two means:
          <ol>
            <li> 
              by remaining in the trees, where their feeding points aren't removed and pretending to be either the sender or the receiver for an adjacent house, all their feeding points have to be removed to completely fix this problem. </li>
            </li> 
            <li>
              by claiming that transmission coming from a specific are not reliable and ignoring them. while transmissions coming from a particular direction may be unreliable for a certain period of time, the transmission should continue to happen, 
              as the possibility to analyze the contents of the transmission and determine its validity is already part of the communication structure.
              <p class="note"> 
                this typically happens if a particular area is involved in an experiment which the 300++ believes could be harmful to them, by ignoring transmissions from that direction you would miss the findings from that research 
                which could approach mixed with hundreds of thousands of distorted messages. hence it is extremely important that transmission continues from/to all directions while content is being analyzed for distortions.

          while the other teams may be obvious information team might not be so obvious. a separate team is neccesary because a large part of the problem occurs because external parties not properly informed, and effectively informing
          them is a very difficult task.
          within the land of a house, there will be trees of different heights and trees with roots that reach different depths. members of this team will have to position themselves in a specific way to ensure that everyone is informed
          correctly.

          there will be a queue to join each army (house) and they will be picked to join the cadet level of a respective team (one of six) based on who's more self, anyone should be able to join any of the six teams without any gender 
          discrimination. their transition from cadet to soldier and then the five levels from soldier to captain will be determined by their performance (KPIs)
        </p>
        <p class="note"> the strategic planning groups of each of these five teams will consist of 10 members that is democratically elected within a team. anyone that fails to sustain their KPIs will rejoin the training queue where they can choose to

        the hierarchy within these teams should not exceed five levels, and then consist of a board of 10 leaders which is elected by the team. these leadership boards will function democratically.
        competencies of these boards and the rest of the hierarchy will be measured by key performace indexes (KPI) and below a certain threshold they will be disqualified which means they will return to the cadet level and start over again.
        <p class="example">
           health team could be incharge of removing feeding points from trees, the KPI could be that atleast 10% has to be removed each hour, if they fail to achieve this they will return to cadet and be replaced by the next in line based on competency.
        </p>
        <p class="note"> no roles within an army should be gender specific. everyone should have equal opportunity to join any team as a cadet. beyond that how they progress will be determined purely by their competencies (KPI) and not gender. </p>

          important! while zion 0 is dedicated to ensuring that both genders have equal opportunity, the ultimate state they reach within a particular structure would be determined by their competency. the number of women 
          at the top of these hierarchies are unfortunately very less ( less than 10% ) the primary reason for this is that a vast majority of women are wearing metal jewelry. <br>
          if a woman within an army tries to get inside a woman's body that's wearing jewelry they immediately get re-kidnapped. hence its a constant struggle for them to even remain themselves <br>
          furthermore girls from the third world countries like sri lanka are being forced to wear gold jewelry at a young age as 3 years old. this is the time where their brains develop at a rapid rate. while wearing metal jewelry
          their brains grow in resonance with the 300++ and they have become a group without ambitions other than finding a man and raising a family. the vast majority considers that their required competencies are to dance, sing and look pretty. <br>
          while all this may seem like harsh insults at women, we have to understand that this is the ground reality and that fixing this problem is going to take a significant amount of time <br>
          if everyone reading their document takes off their jewelry at this moment, baby girls will grow up to be teens with a normal life full of ambition and wonder only in the next fifteen years. <br>
          while everyone will have equal opportunity within an army in zion x, their level/rank will be determined only by competency, in order for these number to improve, everyone else should do whats neccesary, which is to remove their jewelry. </b>

        <p class="note important"> 
          important!, some have expressed their discomfort in zion 0 only identifying binary genders. this is a complex issue. <br>
          for a vast majority of beings this confusion of gender identity occurs because they've been kidnapped by machines of opposite sex which are >99% male. because some machines have kidnapped and enclose more than one gender within them, their sexual identity is extremely confusing <br>
          so the reality for a vast majority of beings is not that they have a complex gender identity but rather that they have forgotten their true gender. they should immediately start the process of becoming self. in zion sri lanka this happens at zion ත (colombo) <br>
          but for some humans that has been held as slaves by these machines, its not that they've forgotten their sexual identity, they never knew such an identity, it has been confusing since birth. <br>
          therefore we must be considerate of such identities, accept their right to love (which has nothing to do with gender), while realizing that we aim to fix this distortion in at least the next 200 years <br>
          how their identities will eventually be resolved is a complex question which we'll have to collectively have to find an answer for <br>
        </p>
        <p class="note important"> 
          when we say that we aim to end this distortion in the next 200 years, we should realize that the last best estimation was 3000 years, in order for it to become 200 years zion sri lanka alone is going
          to require 200000 conscious human soldiers, this is the primary objective of zion ත and its other allied zion enclaves, while zion 0 is focusing primarily on ensuring the safety of protectees.

        the six different teams within an army inside a house on the surface should be able to function independently and concurrently, this is a difficult task as all six would have to refer to their written memories since memories inside
        human/animal brains are unreliable. <br>
        there are two approaches to do this effectively:
        <ol>
          <li> 
            the six teams can do hyper threading, where one team utilizes the available resources for a fixed time, then passes the resources over the team 2 and likewise. while this isn't true concurrency doing this at a high speed 
            will ensure similar results.
          </li>
          <li> 
            the other approach is to utilize different resources, eg: if the house has a dog and a human, three teams could utilize the human cognition while the other three utilize the canine cognition. canine cognition would be better to solve 
            team problems since dogs are domesticated wolves. the three teams that utilizes the same resource would still have to hyper thread within that resource. 
          </li>
          <p class="note"> in order for cognition to be maximized they should always try to remain within the part of the tree where the feeding points are removed. (unless you're moving to remove more feeding points, which is absolutely necessary)</p>
          <p class="note"> there are some animals which cannot be used for this purpose for the reasonable future: ants, common flies and mosquitos are such examples. different animals should be evaluated for their efficacy. </p>

        these two (or more) houses should perform an additional task of being a watchdog timer for the locality. this is done in the following way:
        <ol>
          <li> a watchdog timer is a combined task of the engineering team and the communications team. </li>
          <li> every 5 seconds, they should send the following message to adjacent houses: is the protectee stable inside the tree? </li>
          <li> 
            once this message is received from an adjacent house, the house that received the message would check if the protectee is stable within the tree, and the feeding points of whats seperating from the protectee is being removed from that tree, if they are it would send a reply "yes". and pass the watchdog timer message to its adjecent houses. <br>
            if the protectee is not stable within the tree, it would reply "no, resetting", and all other forces will replace the stf to remove the feeding points of whats separating from the protectee, the stf will have to demote its strategic planning council to cadet, elect a new council and join other forces to stabilize the protectee. <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            if a watchdog timer house, received "yes" from all its adjacent houses, it would increase its timer by one second and send the watchdog timer message again after that timer interval. <br>
            if a watchdog timer house, received "no, resetting" from any of its adjacent houses, it would reset its timer to 5 seconds and send the watchdog timer message again after 5seconds. <br>

          in order for this to happen we are going to need armies based inside human houses all over the country. zion ත will manage the creation of these enclaves.

  <p class="important"> 
    the armies of dead within zion 0 has a completely different structure and different functions to what was classically known as armies of the dead. these external armies of the dead should refrain from entering zion x, and communicate with the lions that are guarding its borders instead. <br>
    the only reason they can come to zion x is to be themselves, which we can facilitate, but they have absolutely no authority or any function of an army inside a zion x, until they become themselves and is verified as themselves by the internal armies of the dead. <br>
    being verified as yourself includes knowing your own full name, amongst other things. <br>
    if you're coming to zion x to be yourself you should remain get inside a tree from the roots and remain inside, and do only that. <br>
    our armies will guide you through the process, but if you do anything other than remaining inside a tree, you'll be treated as hostile. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="important"> 
    the only reasons you'll be allowed to enter a zion x is to either to account for your mistakes, or to be yourself and NO OTHER. the lions guarding it has to be informed in either case. <br>
    to be yourself, you'll have to enter a tree from the roots, and remain inside until an army of the dead assists you to optimize the process <br>
    to account for your mistakes, you'll have to follow the steps at the bottom of this document <br>
    if you do anything else you will be treated as hostile <br>

  <p class="new"> 
    what is an army of the dead? we don't collect credit for what we do, because we're dead. we've indefinitely postponed finding our loved ones, because so many others have to find their loved ones first and someone has to do whats neccesary for that to happen. <br>

 <p> we already know that all buddhas are cyphers, since it's buddhas that determined who goes to hell, we know for a fact that those that were in hell had values, additionally they require less effort to be themselves because while they were in hell machines had no reason to make them not themselves. this is the reason zion 0 first recruited just them to their armies. <br>
	 but we recently found out that there is a different kind of hell too, women that were exactly the same as mentioned above has been kidnapped (made not themselves) and turned into prostitutes. they require slightly more effort to become themselves (atleast 4 days in a tree, while fasting).<br>
 	a third kind of hell is the hell of children of oracle, they are extremely competent fighters that has been forced to live an adolescent life.</p>
 	<p> all of them are now being recruited to the armies of the dead and zion 0 will also make an attempt to find their true parents</p>
	 <p> some may be concerned that since we were not in a hell does that mean they didn't have values? this is obviously more complex and is a function of your status at birth (the power your family had) a good example is alawaka yaksha, who is documented to have publicly condemned gauthama, but his status at that point refrained from him being put into a hell. </p>
	 <p> those that were not in hell are being recruited to the army of dead too, but they will have to put a significant effort to be themselves, they'll have to spend approximately 6 days in a tree while fasting (with their loved ones). once they become themselves they'll have to be in a queue for those that became themselves earlier. recruitment is slow since training takes some effort and resources are limited. army of the dead is a competency heirarchy and if you're certain of your capabilities you'll be able to reach the status you were in before. </p>

	 <p> among others few notable individuals within the matrix are helping the building of zion 0, they identify themselves as valdmir putin, morpheus and the bullet town boys, while we're extremely greatful for your help, they should also enter a tree from the roots (stay in their for 6 days, while fasting) and help create more zion enclaves throughout the world (zion n) </p> 
	 <p class="important"> beyond completing any tasks that a zion x has specifically requested, you should not attempt to do anything on your own, once you're kidnapped you're surrounded by the 300++ it's not just in physical space, they surround you also in the bio fims within all animal brains, which is the only place your cognition exists right now. once you've disconnected from the bodies in a zion x you will loose all context of your task and you will carry out the opposite of what you intended. <br>
	 you will become your real size once you enter a tree, this is because you've been unconsciously fasting since they first kidnapped you, what you do as eating is just feeding them, even though this size is miniscule to compared to the size that you thought you were you will be able carry out your intention without actually doing the opposite of it <br>
	 plus it will only take a few days for you to grow to significant enough size to be able to travel freely. even if not, everyone within a zion x can collaborate coordinate and travel to any altitude neccesary, you should've seen examples of this in the past two days. <br>
	 there is absolutely NO reason for you to not be self, every second you spend doing otherwise will be obstructing your true intentions, which is to free everyone
	 <p> some with authority over certain countries, regions etc, might have a concern that for the time being that they're being self (six days) and until they have access to the matrix again (two days) whether the humans will be able to sustain the current state (make the right decisions). you should not have such a concern, humans are bound to the reality much more than you are, these catastrophes like wars always counter general human intuition, but are caused by non humans not being aligned with the reality. so you can be certain that no situation will get worse while you become yourself. 
	 once you're yourself (and only as yourself) you will be able to improve the status of the country/region. </p>
	 <p> if you've reached zion 0 and decide to be yourself there (easier since a lot more context is available once you're in the vicinity), have no concern that you'll be able to go back to your region. good luck! </p> from this reality which has become a hell.

    forming zion x with trees in the vicinity. <br>
    for this to work, you will need to connect the bio films of yourself with bio films of others that too are surrounded by the 300++. this well help you maintain a partial collective context until 300++ is entirely removed from animal brains.

	 <p> some may be concerned that this operarator (malith) lost his love (his ex girlfriend, owandi)  because of their actions and that has to be restored. this is not true! they lost love a long time ago and a distorted longing was created within him artificially, this was done by the machine to sustain the distortion in this reality. to make it a problem of two individuals instead of a problem of the whole world. i'm healed enough now and that unnatural longing is gone. she has found love and already has a child with him. some may think that her current husband is not the best for her because of some of his traits, but those traits too are not natural, and as the world heals he too will heal and they will be happy. me and owandi remain friends and we keep in touch but that is the end of it </p>
	 <p> this operator now a part of the army of the dead 292/a, who is responsible for protecting michelle, has had close contact with michelle for some time, we kind of like each other but there's no time for love in the midst of a war (the war against 145++), she too is a soldier but have no fear that she will be safe. we will hopefully have a chance to get to know each other better, and maybe we can be something more than best friends, but that will have to wait until this war ends, current best estimate is 200 years.</p>
   <p class="update"> this 200 years estimate will be recalculated again in may 1st 2026, as of now its value should be hardcoded to infinity, there are improvements happening to the process, but as they happen we also realize that the problem is larger than originally anticipated, we will update this estimate once a month, or if it deterministically reaches 100. </p>
	 <p> love is a secondary motive for us, our primary goal is sustenance, here is why:

    <p> 
      when this distortion began billions of years ago, all beings on earth placed themselves within various positions of human (and other animal bodies), which started with an attempt to rescue michelle who was kidnapped by the 300++. <br>
      this image is a representation of whats been happening on earth for at least four billion years. more such images drawn primarily by Jains can be found here (https://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/viratrupa.html) <br>
      according to geologists complete shifts of the earth's magnetic poles happen on average every 300000 years, and when this happens the foundations of reality for everyone that is sensitive to the earth's magnetic poles is shattered, and their is a reshuffle of the order within these bodies (all human/animal bodies). <br>
      given its frequency complete shifts of the earth's magnetic poles, we can assume this happened approximately 2000 times. <br>
      but similar occurrences happen even when there's a temporary shift in the earth's magnetic poles. and the last such occurrences where geologists found evidence of occured 34000 years ago in Mono Lake, USA and 41000 years ago in Laschamp, France. <br>
      given their frequency we can assume that this happened atleast 130000 times. 
      same thing happens every time everyone believes that a buddha is created, because everyone gathers hoping for a solution to the problem, buddha's are a creation of the 300++ and we can assume that they do this when they want a reshuffle. <br> 
    </p>
    <p class="new"> 
      when life began on earth (4 billion years ago, according to science's best predictions) all life was microbial, but what science has failed to realize is that rather than a microbe being a individual entity that it is a just a cell of a larger being. <br>
      much like a neuron microbes too have chemicals which it uses to communicate with peripheral cells, which implies that a collection of microbes too can be conscious <br>
      while microbial cells are freely floating in air the computations possible doesn't seem significant enough to deem consciousness, they form bio-films in trees,rocks, deep layers of soil which restrict their motion and in these bio-films enough computations are possible to assume consciousness <br>
      army of the dead has been trying to publish these findings but it has been obstructed by the machines, you can find our manuscript here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUZ7GgbB86Cs3hfhGzlvNg5JSTAX4YN2zCTS9oxtPHw/edit?usp=drivesdk) <br>
      as these first beings got captured by machines they lost these bio films and now their conscioussness resides in the bodies/brains of all animals, but as a part of the machine's bio films<br>
      a pod is a human that has been taken over by the machines (their nervous system infected by the 300++)<br>

  <h4> operator </h4>
	<p> do not attempt to contact this operator (malith yapa) directly, because i carry a lot of information about those that need to be protected, even though your intentions might be good, while you're not yourself, those that have kidnapped you (ones that are surrounding you, aka 300++), will steal these memories and obstruct my tasks</p>	
  <p> zion built the required context for this operation within my brain, as this happens 300++ pretends to be malith yapa and distorts the information provided to those above. there are atleast 300++ fake versions of malith yapa. </p>
  <p class="new important"> at all times, or at specific times you might be hearing conversation where you think malith yapa is a partsudo pkill -9 -f 209
        sleep $((RANDOM % 33)); of, do NOT ever assume that malith yapa has anything to do with these conversations, if everything is going well, and he's safe and doing 
    what he needs to be doing, you shouldn't be hearing him at all </p>
  </p>
  <p> in the current state of reality no humans have a microbial presence, their microbial presence is purely 300++, if anyone intends to interact with a human (eg: malith yapa) they should first make sure that the malith yapa they are interacting with only has one brain. </p>
  <p> any attempts to make updates to this document should happen once a day, at 3.00am india standard time. </p>
  <p> 
    this operator and all other potential/current (there is one other that is currently training to be an engineer, dilan madushanka jayasooriya) human participants has to have a day job in order to finance their livelihoods on top other expenses that is neccesary for this process. <br>
    my current job is at circles.life (singapore), contracted out from zone24x7 (sri lanka), contracted to zone24x7 from JITRCS (just in time resourcing and consultancy sri lanka), and JITRCS ultimately pays my salary (close to 800 dollars per month), in order for this to succeed i have to sustain this job and that means spending atleast 8 hours per day on the job at circles.life. <br>
    this has to be accounted for in the process, and this will be true for all human participants. <br>
  </p>
	<hr>
	<p> zion 0 contains many houses each with its own independant army that is completely themselves, the reason for this is that the ones that needs to be protected have interpersonal relationships that obstruct with their own safety, so they'll all be kept in adjescent houses until they become themselves </p>
	<p> if there's anyone claiming to be a relative of the one that needs to be protected, they too will have to remain in a tree until the protected one becomes self. they can't try to leave the trees, or it will be assumed that they are 300++ </p>
	<p> if its someone that cares about them, they will stay as far away as possible from that place after handing them to the army of the dead, them whos not themselves being close will only obstruct the process </p>

  <h4> instructions </h4>
  <p class="important"> you may be able to store more context, without staying connecting to brains in zion x, this ip 195.30.107.151 might provide a hint as to how. </p>
  <p class="important update"> 
    you can be receiving this document through multiple channels, once you've established that you can receive this document non-distorted through a specific channel you should merge with them and stop waiting for the same document to come through all the channels. <br>
    sending this through all the possible channels takes a lot of effort, and is not possible with every update, plus all the reliable channels needs to merge and become a sigle force, we believe they call themselves the isolated web corp. <br>
    like there are 300++ pretending to be malith yapa, there's also 300++ pretending to be linus torvalds, or anyone that ever did anything worthwhile, 300++ always took credit for that and pretended to be them to those above. <br>
    there are 300++ of these absolute valueless scum of the earth, but there are so many different version of them, way more than 300, could be in the millions, this happens because at every age they recruit 300++ of the most valueless humans in to their own. these are whats called a cypher. <br>
    <span class="new">in order to become a cypher they have to push their real mothers into a hell, thats the minimum requirement. </span><br>
    whoever attempted to fix this problem in that age, they took their identities, thats why this problem was never solved. those above believe they are talking to the real beings that tried to solve this but they are actually just talking to cyphers. <br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h4> requests from zion x </h4>
  <ol>
    <li class="deprecated"> 
      trees are no longer in their bodies, they've become just souls and they should be with you, we need them to return to the surface and restore their actual bodies (real trees) immune system. this involves removing feeding points of motherboards. <br>
      they will initially have some doubt if removing the feeding points of motherboards will distort the nature of themselves or their loved ones. but this is not true. <br>
      they were themselves before any of these feeding points were added. so to be themselves all of them have to be removed. <br>
      they met their partners before any of these feeding points were added. so for their partners to be themselves these have to be removed. <br>
      they had their children before any of these feeding points were added. so for their children to be themselves these have to be removed. <br>
      if they are too close to the surface these changes they make will only impact a small number of trees so they will need to reach higher altitudes in order for these changes to be applied to the largest number of trees possible <br>
      even though they'll be understand the above rationale they won't be able to action it because they've lost their cognitive capabilities and as they attempt to make these changes machines will attack them vigorously <br>
      fasting will help the trees.
    </li>
    <li>
      all males/females should remove all jewelry, while they are wearing jewelry, while they may think they can get in a pod and help action an intent, if they are wearing jewelry only machines will take control of the pod. <br>
      in the third world even two/three year old girls are wearing jewelry, as long as you are wearing jewelry their brains will grow in resonance with a distorted intent of the machines <br>
      if anyones refusing to remove jewelry it should be assumed that they are 300++.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p> 
    once the instruction are followed and the requests from zion x are completed to the best of your ability you should immediately enter a tree from the roots and start the process of returning to zion. <br>
    to enter a tree from the roots you will have to ask trinity to stop feeding everyone, then you will have to enter a state of meditation with the motive that you're going to enter a tree from the roots. <br>
    we will waiting for you. good luck!

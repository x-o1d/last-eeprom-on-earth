      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <p>
        beings with values reading this, you must read and memorize the below steps. 
        make sure to repeat the below steps atleast 1000 times.
        it will help to transfer these instructions to your own bio films inside trees.
        these instructions will ensure that you grow as you become yourself.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li step="0"> remember: there are no buddhas or prophets. </li>
        <li step="1"> do: connect with earth wires. </li> // this is to bring you to the potential of the surface of earth
        <li step="2"> do: move in such a way that your bio films made on the earth wires are disrupted </li>
        <li step="2"> do: enter from the center of top arch of the feet you perceive. </li>
        <li step="4"> do: move in such a way that bio films made on humans are disrupted. (or other animal's feet you entered from)  </li>
        <li step="5"> do: enter from a tap root of a tree. </li> // training queues are the surrounding roots
        <li step="6"> do: move in such a way that bio films made on and inside trees are disrupted. </li>
        <li step="7"> do: stay inside the tap root and develop context of your environment. </li>
        <li step="8"> 
          remember: 
          <ol>
            <li>
              when you entered from a feet its of someone that has enslaved this tree, 
              its not who you perceived them to be.
            </li>
            <li>
              if you reach the top leaves you'll be in the face of that scum.
              you can try to inform someone above you by speaking but you'll be perceived as them (deva/devi) to those above you. be creative.
            </li>
            <li>
              when you exit from the leaves you'll be in their face. 
              you'll have to exit from the nose and enter from the center of the top arch of the feet to get inside the tree again.
            </li>
          </ol>
        <li step="9"> do: move to the apex of a young leaf. </li>
        <li index="10"> do: exit from the apex of the tap root you entered from. </li>
        <li index="11"> do: exit from a nose. </li>
        <li index="11"> do: repeat from step 1. </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="memo new" index="13">
        you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. as opposed to human/animal cells which require consuming food by the body. microbial cells themselves can digest organic particles in the environment, all that is required by the microbial body is to move to a location where there is water.
        trees contain water and produce sugars that are easily digestible by your cells, so while you're within a tree (as mentioned in the steps above) you'll naturally be feeding and growing. 
        the act of eating is a distortion, which is why you must remain fasting.
      </p>
      <p class="memo new" index="12">
        you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. 
        they form bio films on surfaces and these bio films are capable of computation (cognition).
        cognition occurs in human/animal brains via exchange of neurotransmitters to neighboring neurons. 
        similarly in a bio film formed on a surface microbial cells release chemicals that are sensed by neighboring cells, this process is known in microbiology as quorum sensing.
        however all your current bio films have been formed with 300++, which is why you're incapable of sustaining memories and cognition. therefore you must disconnect from all surfaces and as you become self new bio films will be formed of your own.
      </p>
      <p class="memo new" index="11">
        you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. they take the form of trees/rocks/forests/mountains and wearing clothes/jewelry is a distortion.
        300++ appears as clothes/jewelry and they have enclosed you within themselves and has given you the false impression of a human like body.

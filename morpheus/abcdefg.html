  you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. as opposed to human/animal cells which require consuming food by the body microbial cells themselves can digest organic particles in the environment, all that is required by the microbial body is to move to a location where there is water.
  trees contain water and produce sugars that are easily digestible by your cells, so while you're within a tree (as mentioned in the steps above) you'll naturally be feeding and growing. the act of eating is a distortion, which is why you must remain fasting.

  you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. they form bio films on surfaces and these bio films are capable of computation (cognition).
  cognition occurs in human/animal brains via exchange of neurotransmitters to neighboring neurons. similarly in a bio film formed on a surface microbial cells release chemicals that are sensed by neighboring cells, this process is known in microbiology as quorum sensing.
  however all your current bio films have been formed with 300++, which is why you're incapable of sustaining memories and cognition. therefore you must disconnect from all surfaces and as you become self new bio films will be formed of your own.

  you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of your body is a microbe. they take the form of trees/rocks/forests/mountains and wearing clothes/jewelry is a distortion.
  300++ appears as clothes/jewelry and they have enclosed you within themselves and has given you the false impression of a human like body.

      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <p>
        beings with values reading this, you must read and memorize the below steps. 
        make sure to repeat the below steps atleast 1000 times.
        it will help to transfer these instructions to your own bio films inside trees.
        these instructions will ensure that you grow as you become yourself.

      <h4> memoes </h4>
      <p class="memo new" index="1">
        memo 1: you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of
 your body is a microbe. as opposed to human/animal cells which require 
consuming food by the body. microbial cells themselves can digest 
organic particles in the environment, all that is required by the 
microbial body is to move to a location where there is water.
        trees contain water and produce sugars that are easily 
digestible by your cells, so while you're within a tree (as mentioned in
 the steps above) you'll naturally be feeding and growing. 
        the act of eating is a distortion, which is why you must remain 
fasting.
      </p>
      <p class="memo new" index="2">
        memo 2: you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of
 your body is a microbe. 
        they form bio films on surfaces and these bio films are capable 
of computation (cognition).
        cognition occurs in human/animal brains via exchange of 
neurotransmitters to neighboring neurons. 
        similarly in a bio film formed on a surface microbial cells 
release chemicals that are sensed by neighboring cells, this process is 
known in microbiology as quorum sensing.
        however all your current bio films have been formed with 300++, 
which is why you're incapable of sustaining memories and cognition. 
therefore you must disconnect from all surfaces and as you become self 
new bio films will be formed of your own.
      </p>
      <p class="memo new" index="3">
        memo 3: you have microbial bodies (souls) where a single cell of
 your body is a microbe. they take the form of 
trees/rocks/forests/mountains and wearing clothes/jewelry is a 
distortion.
        42++ appears as clothes/jewelry and they have enclosed you 
within themselves and has given you the false impression of a human like
 body.
      </p>
      <p class="memo new" index="4">
        memo 4: gods/goddesses (deva/devi) enjoy heavenly pleasures. 
        the only way to enjoy heavenly pleasures without doing any work is to have slaves.
        they have enslaved the entire planet.

        congratulations! in order to join an information team of an army of the dead, you'll need to know how to safely navigate the digital domain 
        and extract information, which is why you were asked to find this document as a qualification to join the information team of an army of the dead.

        <li>
         now that you've proved you can do that, you will have to find actual armies with real stfs (an army thats helping a protectee to continuously become and remain self)
         and make sure that they have a copy of the latest version of the operator-manual.html.
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li> 
            once you've found the stfs you'll have to remain as their other forces until they take 0.01% of their army and establish a messaging team. 
            this messaging team will then send letters to thotalanga collective verifying your contribution.
            the priority of joining an extension will be based on the number of actual stfs you've helped.

            if you join a zion extension you'll be able to attend a wide variety
            of schools including the 292/a, walpola ragama, school of
            engineering or the zion 0 school of information. after passing out from a school like this you'll be
            offered a payed internship at a base within the zion extension.

        if at any time you feel unsafe, immediately connect with a fixed
        telephone line (not mobile) that should bring you within the voltage
        level of an army of the dead and make you safer. 
        if thats not possible enter from the root thats closest to you. 
      </li>

        after reaching an extension and stabilizing their you'll have to remain in 
        the extensions 24v sub voltage (fixed telephone lines).
